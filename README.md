# DNA/RNA Translator

A user-friendly GUI tool built with Python and Tkinter for translating DNA or RNA sequences into protein sequences. This tool includes support for translating all reading frames, both forward and reverse, with codon tables for DNA and RNA.

## Features
- **Sequence Input**: Input sequences directly into the application or load them from a file.
- **Translation Modes**:
  - DNA to Protein (using all 6 reading frames).
  - RNA to Protein (using all 6 reading frames).
- **Reverse Complement Translation**: Translate reverse reading frames.
- **Validation**: Automatically checks for valid DNA/RNA sequences.
- **Error Handling**: Displays meaningful error messages for invalid inputs.
- **Interactive UI**: Tooltips and buttons for ease of use.
